In honor of the Opening Day for MLB's 2021 Season, I mocked up the old Busch Stadium scoreboard with it's final record. This board and box score is still on display in one of the concourses of the new stadium. The styling for this project was done purely with CSS, with an emphasis on the Grid layout. I'm hoping to use this project going forward to implement some functionality with JavaScript... Stay tuned, and Go Cards!
